Vortex Watch v6 Hardware Bringup
-------------------------------
9/21/2022:
- Integrated touch pad handling with Freetouch library into watch code and verified that it's working as expected
- Verified that DRDY interrupt works as expected by setting up accelerometer datastreaming
- Noticing quite a lot of noise on accelerometer datastream. Need to investigate whether this is a driver issue or with the sensor

9/20/2022:
- 2nd touch pin not connected to analog pin as defined by Arduino, but it does connect to an ADC/PTC channel (AIN[17]/X[1]). Need to investigate to see 
  if can use Freetouch library with this pin.
    - Pin PA09 doesn't seem seem to be compatible with the FreeTouch library. From what I can tell, it needs to be a "Y" PTC pin, not an "X", which means
      it must be 1 of the following pins [PA02, PA03, PA04, PA05, PA06, PA07, PB02, PB03, PB08, PB09]. 
    - To get it working I depopped the AREF cap and added a fly wire from PA03(newly exposed pad) to the touch connection

9/18/2022:
- Batt test pin doesn't seem to be connected to analog input pin. Unclear if can measure battery level this way. [FAIL]
- Fuel gauge doesn't seem to be responding over I2C, needs further investigation. [TBD]
    - Fuel gauge is responding to 0x76 for some reason. Check with Nolan where the ICs were purchased from.
        - Purchased from Ebay, other people online have had issues with these from ebay. Likey a knockoff chip.
    - While gauge is responding, the cell voltage and RSOC readings don't make sense. Will attempt to do quick restart command to see if that helps.
        - Quick restart command did not seem to help

9/17/2022:
- Noticed that 1HZ clock from RTC wasn't getting output. Turns out it was being gated by CLKOE pin, needed to set pin to output HIGH in code. [SUCCESS]
- Even after getting 1HZ to output, I wasn't seeing the clock tick as expected. Needed to adjust pin mappings for 1HZ clock interrupt pin. [SUCCESS]
- Verified I2C access to RTC and Accelerometer [SUCCESS]
- Verified control of debug LED [SUCCESS]
- Verified control of RGB LEDs [SUCCESS]
- Tried testing touch sensing useing Freetouch library, but not getting output expected. Needs further investigation. [TBD]
